Project title - Incremental Dimensionality Reduction And one class classification on NHRR data set

NHRR data set is a dataset of handwritten digits generated by our own 

Each image is of size 50x50 pixels

Image_taken_0 folder contains the original image taken 

Original image is resized to 50x50 pixels image which is stored in 0_50by50 

Resized image is cropped to make a smooth boundary around the digit and that is stored in folder Crop_0

Cropped image is again upscaled to 50x50 pixels stored in Last_0 folder

200 Features are extracted from each image stored in file features_0.txt

Each digit has 600 images

All_digits_SVM.py contains both the built in and our own classifier and accuracy obtained is as follows -
